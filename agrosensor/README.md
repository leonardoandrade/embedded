# Agro Sensor 🌱

Agro Sensor is an IoT project focused on environmental monitoring in agriculture. It utilizes an AZDelivery ESP8266 microcontroller to capture data from various sensors such as soil moisture, sunlight exposure, and temperature. The data collected is transmitted to an InfluxDB database, providing a platform for storage and analysis.

## Getting Started 🚀

To deploy Agro Sensor, clone the repository to your local environment. Make sure you have the ESP8266 microcontroller and the required sensors. Update the `config.h` file with your Wi-Fi network details and InfluxDB credentials. Once the settings are configured, compile and upload the `agrosensor.ino` sketch to the microcontroller. The device will connect to your Wi-Fi network and start transmitting sensor data to InfluxDB.

## Usage 📊

Agro Sensor functions autonomously, regularly collecting environmental data and uploading it to a remote InfluxDB. Access to this real-time data is vital for making informed decisions in agricultural management.

## Project Structure 🏗️

The project includes essential files for setting up both the hardware and software components. The firmware responsible for sensor data collection and network communication is contained within the `agrosensor.ino` file. Configuration constants are stored in the `config.h` file.

## Latest Changes 🔄

The project has been updated with several enhancements, including:

- A photograph of the open box setup to aid in understanding the physical configuration.
- A Wi-Fi repeater bootstrap feature for improved network connectivity.
- An LED controller for visual status indication.
- Updated README documentation for better clarity.
- Reorganized library locations for more efficient project management.

## TODOS 📝

Planned improvements for Agro Sensor are:

- Expanding compatibility with additional sensor types.
- Optimizing power management to allow for prolonged operation in the field.
- Creating a user-friendly dashboard for enhanced data visualization.
- Enhancing Wi-Fi connectivity and extending its range.
- Implementing secure data transmission through data encryption.
